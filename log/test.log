[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/v1/sign_up.json?user%5Bemail%5D=ward%40poopshispants.com&user%5Bpassword%5D=stinkbreath".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/v1/sign_up.json".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]

  Parameters: {"api_v1_user"=>{"email"=>"ward@poopshispants.com", "password"=>"[FILTERED]"}}
[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/v1/users/sign_in.json?api_v1_user%5Bemail%5D=ward%40poopshispants.com&api_v1_user%5Bpassword%5D=stinkbreath".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]
